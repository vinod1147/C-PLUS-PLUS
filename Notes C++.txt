Low Level means hardware ke nazdik
High Level means logical sound aur hardware se dur
C++ is low level language
On low level everything is processed on form of numbers
Variables are containers to store your data
Comments are written using two forward slashes //
For multi-line comments use /* your comments here */
Types of Variables in C++ are:- Int, Float, Char, Double, Boolean
Based on scope variables are classifed into two types:- 1. Local Variables 2.Gloabal variables
Scope of variables is the region in code where the existence of variable is valid
Local Variables are declared inside the braces of any function and can be accessed only from there
Global Variables are declared oubside any function and can be accessed from anywhere
Data types define the type of data a variable can hold
Data types in C++ are categorised in three groups:- 1. Built-in 2. User-defined 3. Derived
User Defined data types in C++ are Struct, Union, Enum
Derived data types in C++ are Array, function and Pointer
Rules to declare variables in C++ --> Variables names in C++ can range 1 to 255 characters, All variables names must begin with a letter, variable names can also contain letters and numbers, Variable names are case sensitive, No spaces or special characters are allowed, You cannot use a C++ keyword(a reserved word) as variable name
In C++ sequences of bytes corresponding to input and output are commonly known are streans
Input Stream: Direction of flow of bytes takes place from input device(for ex. Keyboard) to the main memory
Output Stream: Direction of flow of bytes takes place from main memory to the output device (for ex. Display)
The operator use after the cout is insertion operator
The operator use after the oin is Extraction operator
Reserved Keyboards are not available for re-definition or overloading
There are tow types of herder file- Systerm header file it comes with the compiler, User define header files: It is written by the programmer 
Constants cannot be changed
Control Structures in C++ are Sequence Structure, Selection Structure and Loop Structure these are basic control structures
Sequence Structure = Entry --> Action 1 --> Action 2 --> Exit
Selection Structure = Entry --> Condition returns true or false --> Action 2
                                                    |                  |
                                                 Action 1 ------>   Exit the program
Loop Structure = Entry --> Loop with condition --> True, False
                                  |_________________|      |
                                  |________________________|
Three types of loops in C++ are FOr loop, While loop and do-while loop
Break keyword ends the loop
Pointer - Data type which holds the address of otherdata types
& ----> Address of Operator
* ----> Dereferencing of operator
To define multiple variables we use comma (,)
\n ----> Defines the new line
Local variable has more priority than the global variables
Local and global variables can be defined by the same name but local variable will have high priority
Bool has 2 values either true or false
When using user defined header files the header file should be in the current directory
Using 'endl' we can also get the new line
Aritmetic Operator in C++ are:- +, -, *, /, (value)++, (value)--, --(value), ++(value)
Assignment operator are used to assign values to variables
Comparison operator are used to compare
Locgical operator are used to see if the both are true or not
Logical operators:- &&, ||
C++ also has bit wise operators
Scope Resolution operator (::) to print global values
By deafualt decimals are double in C++
If we write 'f' after the number it is known as floating number we can also use the capital letter 
If we write 'l' after the number it is known as long double number we can also use the capital letter
If we declare the variable with '&' it is use for reference
Typecasting means changing the variable type
For typecasting we have to write the type of data before the variable
Manipulators help in formating the data which is to be shown
Manipulators:- enl and setw
setw is used to give space in the progarm
Operator precedence specifies the order of operations in experssions that contain more than one operator
do-while loop run 1 time even if condition is false
break is use to stop the program when the required condition is true
An array is a collection of items of similar type stored in contiguous memory localtions. Sometimes a simple variable is not enough to hold all the data
Counting in C++ starts from 0
We can get the address of the int using the '&' 
In arrays the name is address of the first block of array we cannot use &(variableName)
Pointer Aritmetic:- Address new = Address current + i * sizeof(datatype)     
Structures in C++ are user defined data types which are used to store group of items on non-similar data types
Unions provide better memory management
Enum:- Special data type that enables for a variable to be set of predefined Constants
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
A function prototype is a declaration in C++ of a function, its name, parameters and returns type before its actual declaration. This enables the compiler to perform more robust type checking
Formal parameters are alaways variables, while actual parameters do not have to be variables
We have to use inline function when there is less line of code in our function
Static variables in a function: when a variable is declared as static, space for it gets allocated for the lifetime of program
Recursion is a method in C++ which calls itself directly or indirectly until a suitable condition is met
When a function name is overloaded with different jobs it is called Function overloading
C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented features to C language
Procedure Oriented Progarmming:- CHECK BELOW
1. Consists of writing a set of instruction for the computer to follow
2. Main focus is on functions and not on flow of Data
3. Functions can either use local or global data
4. Data moves openly form function to function
Object Oriented Progarmming:- CHECK BELOW
1. Works on the concept of classes and objects
2. A class is a template to create objects
3. Treats data as a critical element
4. Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects
Classes in OOPS - Basic template for creating objects
Objects in OOPS - Basic run time entities
Data Abstraction & Encapsulation in OOPS - Wrapping data and functions into single unit.
Inheritance in OOPS - Properties of one class can be inherited into others
Polymorphism in OOPS - Ability to take more than one forms
Dynamic Binding in OOPS - code which will execute is not known until the program.
Message Passing in OOPS - Object.message(Information) call format
Trick to Remember four pillars of OOPS:- i ate A PIE = A = Abstraction, P = Polymorphism, I = Inheritance and E = Encapsulation.
Benefits of OOPS are:- Better code reusability using objects and Inheritance, Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems, Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference, Software complexity can be easily managed.
Data hiding is not available in structures
We cannot use functions in structures
It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class
A garbage value in means a not meaningful value hold by any variable due to the absense of its initialisation is called garbage value of variable
Private data should be called by the function
C++ was initially called C with calles by stroustroup
Class extension of structures (in C) - structures had limitations - members are public, no methods
classes = structures + more, classes can have methods and Properties, can make few members as private or few as public
Structures in C++ are typedefed
In classes you can declare objects along with the class declaration
By deafualt class members are private
Static variable is initalised by 0 by deafualt
Two properties of static functions are - They can access static data members only, They can run without making any objects for the class
Static variable is only one and it is share by all objects
